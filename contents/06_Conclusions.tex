In the scope of the thesis the ECMAScript TC39 proposal "module blocks" was implemented into the Graal.js project which resides inside the GraalVM ecosystem. The implementation was split into a syntactic and semantic part, with the semantic part being conducted through introducing a new Node according to general Truffle rules and the given proposal specification. The syntactic part was introduced via minor changes in the preexisting Graal.js parser. Testing the implementation consisted of applying the preexisting Test262 official ECMAScript test suite and explicitly for the proposal written unit tests on it. To finish off embedding the proposal a serialization algorithm was written and tested with a proof of concept test via a Worker. Reiterating the fact that the proposal is not finished yet and supposed to undergo changes, it can be said that the base for contributing this stage two proposal to the Graal.js project is laid out.
